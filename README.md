# CatApp

This app is a way to learn from baby steps how I can use the LiveViewNative.

The valuable part is their message event contains the _platform key, which makes it identifiable. If the event does not have the key, it is a browser request.
Knowing it, I created a flow defining a set of one-to-one components.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
